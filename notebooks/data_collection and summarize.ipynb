On the other hand, Salesforce has a high EBITDA and gross profit, indicating strong profitability. However, its low ROE and revenue growth suggest that the company may be facing challenges in generating returns and expanding its business.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cem\\u003eThis article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.\\u003c/em\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\",\"created_at\":\"2024-02-07T16:00:24Z\",\"headline\":\"Comparative Study: Salesforce And Industry Competitors In Software Industry\",\"id\":36984913,\"images\":[],\"source\":\"benzinga\",\"summary\":\" \",\"symbols\":[\"CRM\"],\"updated_at\":\"2024-02-07T16:00:25Z\",\"url\":\"https://www.benzinga.com/insights/news/24/02/36984913/comparative-study-salesforce-and-industry-competitors-in-software-industry\"},{\"author\":\"Benzinga Neuro\",\"content\":\"\\u003cp\\u003eA top executive at\\u003cstrong\\u003e Salesforce Inc \\u003c/strong\\u003e(NYSE:\\u003ca class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/CRM#NYSE\\\"\\u003eCRM\\u003c/a\\u003e) has reportedly warned employees that they could face financial consequences if they fail to meet an internal training goal. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eWhat Happened\\u003c/strong\\u003e: The company\\u0026#8217;s president and chief engineering officer, \\u003cstrong\\u003eSrini Tallapragada\\u003c/strong\\u003e, sent an email to his direct reports, stating that those who do not achieve the \\u0026#8220;ranger\\u0026#8221; rank on the company\\u0026#8217;s internal training platform could miss out on stock grants and bonus payments.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIn an email sent on Jan. 10, Tallapragada reminded employees of the 2023 goal set by Salesforce for all its workers to attain the \\u0026#8220;ranger\\u0026#8221; rank on Trailhead, the company\\u0026#8217;s internal training software. \\u0026#8220;Hopefully all of you are rangers — if not better get going if you want your stock grant and bonus,\\u0026#8221; Tallapragada wrote, \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.businessinsider.com/salesforce-exec-email-trailhead-goal-bonus-2024-2?IR=T\\\"\\u003ereported\\u003c/a\\u003e Business Insider.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAccording to a company spokesperson, 91.4% of employees achieved the ranger status.

Note the following: This article is about the big picture, not an individual stock.&nbsp; The chart of AAPL stock is being used to illustrate the point. The chart shows when the iPhone 15 was launched. The chart shows the move from iPhone 15 launch to today's iPhone 16 launch. Investors are hopeful that the move in AAPL stock from the iPhone 16 launch to the iPhone 17 will be much bigger compared to the stock move between the launch of iPhone 15 and iPhone 16. The chart shows that even though investors have stars in their eyes, for the short term, AAPL stock has traced a negative pattern. The chart shows that AAPL stock hit the top of the resistance zone in July. The chart shows that AAPL stock failed to penetrate the resistance zone. The chart shows that after AAPL stock failed to penetrate the resistance zone, it fell all the way to the bottom band of the support zone. The chart shows that AAPL stock rallied after falling to the bottom of the support zone. The chart shows that the rally stopped at the low band of the resistance zone. Investors are mostly focused on hopes that Apple Intelligence, the name for Apple's artificial intelligence, will start a new super cycle of iPhone sales, and thus lift Apple sales from being sluggish for a long time. Even though there is a lot of exuberance about Apple Intelligence, prudent investors need to remember that the momo crowd focuses only on the bullish factors and ignores the negative factors.&nbsp; In contrast, smart money takes into account both positive and negative factors. There are several negative factors about Apple that the stock market is ignoring right now that prudent investors should be aware of: Apple intelligence will likely not be available in the European Union and China. Even in the U.S., most Apple Intelligence features will not be available right away. The launch of all Apple Intelligence features is staggered over a long period of time. The fact that Apple Intelligence that will initially be present in the iPhone is only half baked may delay the super cycle. The marketing hype about Apple Intelligence is way more than reality. Apple does not own its AI.&nbsp; Apple is licensing its AI from OpenAI. The model behind the AI that Apple is offering is not running on the iPhone or on Apple servers.&nbsp; The model appears to be running on &nbsp;NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) based servers owned by Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT). Apple has been receiving $20B per year from Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) to make Google the default search.&nbsp; A judge has ruled that Google is a monopolist.&nbsp; In due course, the government may force Google to stop paying $20B to Apple. In China, Apple is losing market share to Huawei. Many Chinese believe that Huawei phones are superior to the iPhone. Huawei is trying to crash Apple's iPhone part by introducing the world's first tri-fold phone. Due to geopolitics between the U.S. and China, nationalist sentiment in China is rising against the U.S.&nbsp; This poses a significant risk to Apple since about 20% of Apple sales come from China. We understand that investors are very loyal to Apple.&nbsp; Before sending us hate email for doing a comprehensive analysis, note that Apple is the largest position in The Arora Report&#8217;s ZYX Buy Model Portfolio.&nbsp; Long time members of The Arora Report are long AAPL stock from $4.68. Note that Warren Buffett has been selling AAPL stock. Prudent investors should also be aware that Apple can easily manipulate its stock.&nbsp; After the last Apple event when Apple had carefully staged to run up its stock, Apple stock started falling.&nbsp; Apple aggressively bought its own stock to cause a technical breakout.&nbsp;&nbsp; Apple is clearly anxious about today's event, as demonstrated by the fact that this event is taking place on a Monday, whereas Apple generally does not hold major events on Mondays.&nbsp; Apple is trying to get ahead of a potential European Commission decision on Apple being forced to pay $14B in taxes.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is aggressive buying in stocks this morning due to two reasons: A short squeeze is occurring. The technical pattern with the stock market, especially AI stocks traced on Friday afternoon, historically leads to a selloff on Monday.&nbsp;&nbsp;When stock futures did not open much lower on Sunday night, a short squeeze started.&nbsp; As the night went on, the short squeeze accelerated. The reason stock futures did not open much lower is because Japanese yen weakened.&nbsp; The weakening yen has saved AI stocks from a blood bath this morning.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that a short squeeze and weakening yen saved the stock market means that prudent investors should not become complacent.&nbsp; Pay attention to the protection band.&nbsp; See the Protection Band And What To Do Now section below.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Magnificent Seven Money Flows In the early trade, money flows are positive in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVDA, MSFT, GOOG, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA). In the early trade, money flows are negative in AAPL. In the early trade, money flows are positive in SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ). Momo Crowd And Smart Money In Stocks Investors can gain an edge by knowing money flows in SPY and QQQ. Investors can get a bigger edge by knowing when smart money is buying stocks, gold, and oil. The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD). The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV). The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF (NYSE:USO). Bitcoin Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is range bound.&nbsp; Bitcoin ETFs have seen a negative money flow of $1.2B in the last eight days.&nbsp; This is the longest streak of negative money flows in bitcoins ETFs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Protection Band And What To Do Now It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.&nbsp; The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.&nbsp; If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. A protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash.&nbsp; A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.&nbsp; When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.&nbsp; High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Traditional 60/40 Portfolio Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.&nbsp; Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

       "   \"Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) last week flagged higher capex spending as it battles to gain supremacy in the artificial intelligence arena, and nervy investors sold off the stock on worries concerning a potential margin contraction. A tech venture capitalist said on Monday that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) could be fairly insulated because of the strategy it has chosen. What Happened: Alphabet, Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) are on track to increase capex by about 43% this year, said Deepwater Asset Management&#8217;s Gene Munster in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Apple is a standout among the mega-cap techs, he suggested. &#8220;In what seems like it's operating in an alternate universe, $AAPL's CapEx is expected to be down 9% this year as the company monetizes its distribution in exchange for OpenAI's models and infrastructure,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is one of the reasons why Apple should see record margins sometime in the middle of next year.&#8221; In the March quarter, the company reported gross margin of 46.6%.

On Monday, Cupertino released a new software called Apple Intelligence in the developer beta of iOS 18.1 and the suite of AI features made available will help improve Siri, automatically generate emails and images and sort notifications. The software is expected to be released to the public later this year but it may not be part of the iPhone 16 that will be launched this fall and will be powered by the iOS 18. As Munster said, Apple announced in mid-June that it has forged a partnership with Sam Altman-led OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into the iPhone, iPad and Mac. The arrangement reportedly does not require Apple to pay for the OpenAI association, with the latter making money through distribution.

       "   \"Shares of Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell modestly in premarket trading on Friday, and this assumes importance because all of its Magnificent 7 peers are staring down the barrel. On Thursday, after the market closed, Apple announced that its fiscal year 2024 third-quarter revenue and earnings per share both surpassed expectations and showed growth compared to the previous year. The stock did not respond positively in the after-hours session, as skeptics highlighted concerns about weakness in China. On the earnings call, Team Tim Cook guided September quarter revenue above the Street estimate and also talked up the company&#8217;s AI prospects. Reacting to the results, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives upped his price target for the stock from $275 to $28 and maintained an Outperform rating. The analyst said it was a &#8220;Gold-medal performance,&#8221; adding that the conference call was upbeat. He sees the stronger September guidance as just the &#8220;opening act for the main event which is an AI-driven super cycle starting with iPhone 16 launching in mid-September.&#8221; Tech venture capitalist and Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster said, &#8220;Apple's flywheel is flying,&#8221; said Munster, referring to the active installed base that hit a new record. &#8220;Big picture is it's all about FY25 and FY26 iPhone, Mac and iPad powered by Apple Intelligence.&#8221; See Also: Everything You Need to Know About Apple Stock In premarket trading, Apple stock edged down 0.09% to $218.17, according to Benzinga Pro data.

       "   'Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is losing its mojo in China&#8217;s crucial market as its domestic players gain ground. The uncertainty regarding the availability of the Apple Intelligence feature in the country is an additional downer. The iPhone maker&#8217;s market share in China plunged to sixth place from third in the second quarter of 2024. According to Canalys, Apple had a market share of 14%, down by two basis points year-on-year. Also Read: China&#8217;s Markets Still Manage To Get Nvidia AI Chips Via Smuggling: Report China&#8217;s smartphone shipment grew 10% year-on-year to over 70 million units in the second quarter. Vivo emerged as the number one with a 19% market share by shipping 13.1 million units, up by 15% year-on-year, driven by solid performance in offline channels and robust online sales during the Chinese e-commerce festival. OPPO remained in second position with a 16% market share after shipping 11.3 million units. HONOR came third with a market share of 15%, backed by shipments of 10.7 million units, implying a 4% growth year-on-year. Huawei Technologies Co bagged the fourth position with a 15% market share supported by shipments of 10.6 million units, which grew by 41% year-on-year. Xiaomi Corp (OTC:XIACF) (OTC:XIACY) came fifth with a market share of 14%, backed by a 17% year-on-year shipment increase to 10 million units. Canalys attributed the local brands&#8217; success to the early significant discounts and promotions backed by offline channel enhancements. The local brands continue to tap the Chinese premium smartphone market by integrating generative artificial intelligence, and their deep collaboration with regional supply chains is a significant advantage, Canalys noted. Canalys also flagged Apple&#8217;s struggle to maintain adequate inventory levels, keep retail prices in check, and maintain the margins of channel partners. Huawei&#8217;s $2,800 Mate XT trifold phone launching on September 20 coincides with the release of the iPhone 16 models. Apple&#8217;s iPhone 16 Pro Max&nbsp;starts at $1,199, while the standard iPhone 16 is $799. International Data Corporation (IDC)&nbsp;expects global smartphone shipments to increase by 5.8% to 1.23 billion units in 2024, marking a recovery with generative AI posing as a significant catalyst. However, due to higher competition in China, Android growth is expected to beat Apple iOS. As per IDC, Apple&#8217;s success hinges on its capability to forge&nbsp;local AI partnerships&nbsp;in China. Ivan Lam, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research told SCMP that iPhone market share in the premium segment will likely decline as Huawei and other Chinese brands gain traction. Apple has not yet revealed its plans for AI integration in China, which could place it at a disadvantage in the race to implement AI, SCMP cites Canalys analyst Lucas Zhong. However, Lam noted that pent-up demand for iPhone upgrades may still boost sales in China. Price Action: AAPL stock closed at $222.66 on Wednesday. image via Shutterstock']],\n",

       "   'Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is losing its mojo in China&#8217;s crucial market as its domestic players gain ground. The uncertainty regarding the availability of the Apple Intelligence feature in the country is an additional downer. The iPhone maker&#8217;s market share in China plunged to sixth place from third in the second quarter of 2024. According to Canalys, Apple had a market share of 14%, down by two basis points year-on-year. Also Read: China&#8217;s Markets Still Manage To Get Nvidia AI Chips Via Smuggling: Report China&#8217;s smartphone shipment grew 10% year-on-year to over 70 million units in the second quarter. Vivo emerged as the number one with a 19% market share by shipping 13.1 million units, up by 15% year-on-year, driven by solid performance in offline channels and robust online sales during the Chinese e-commerce festival. OPPO remained in second position with a 16% market share after shipping 11.3 million units. HONOR came third with a market share of 15%, backed by shipments of 10.7 million units, implying a 4% growth year-on-year. Huawei Technologies Co bagged the fourth position with a 15% market share supported by shipments of 10.6 million units, which grew by 41% year-on-year. Xiaomi Corp (OTC:XIACF) (OTC:XIACY) came fifth with a market share of 14%, backed by a 17% year-on-year shipment increase to 10 million units. Canalys attributed the local brands&#8217; success to the early significant discounts and promotions backed by offline channel enhancements. The local brands continue to tap the Chinese premium smartphone market by integrating generative artificial intelligence, and their deep collaboration with regional supply chains is a significant advantage, Canalys noted. Canalys also flagged Apple&#8217;s struggle to maintain adequate inventory levels, keep retail prices in check, and maintain the margins of channel partners. Huawei&#8217;s $2,800 Mate XT trifold phone launching on September 20 coincides with the release of the iPhone 16 models. Apple&#8217;s iPhone 16 Pro Max&nbsp;starts at $1,199, while the standard iPhone 16 is $799. International Data Corporation (IDC)&nbsp;expects global smartphone shipments to increase by 5.8% to 1.23 billion units in 2024, marking a recovery with generative AI posing as a significant catalyst. However, due to higher competition in China, Android growth is expected to beat Apple iOS. As per IDC, Apple&#8217;s success hinges on its capability to forge&nbsp;local AI partnerships&nbsp;in China. Ivan Lam, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research told SCMP that iPhone market share in the premium segment will likely decline as Huawei and other Chinese brands gain traction. Apple has not yet revealed its plans for AI integration in China, which could place it at a disadvantage in the race to implement AI, SCMP cites Canalys analyst Lucas Zhong. However, Lam noted that pent-up demand for iPhone upgrades may still boost sales in China. Price Action: AAPL stock closed at $222.66 on Wednesday. image via Shutterstock']],\n",

The chart shows when the iPhone 15 was launched. The chart shows the move from iPhone 15 launch to today's iPhone 16 launch. Investors are hopeful that the move in AAPL stock from the iPhone 16 launch to the iPhone 17 will be much bigger compared to the stock move between the launch of iPhone 15 and iPhone 16. The chart shows that even though investors have stars in their eyes, for the short term, AAPL stock has traced a negative pattern. The chart shows that AAPL stock hit the top of the resistance zone in July. The chart shows that AAPL stock failed to penetrate the resistance zone. The chart shows that after AAPL stock failed to penetrate the resistance zone, it fell all the way to the bottom band of the support zone. The chart shows that AAPL stock rallied after falling to the bottom of the support zone. The chart shows that the rally stopped at the low band of the resistance zone. Investors are mostly focused on hopes that Apple Intelligence, the name for Apple's artificial intelligence, will start a new super cycle of iPhone sales, and thus lift Apple sales from being sluggish for a long time. Even though there is a lot of exuberance about Apple Intelligence, prudent investors need to remember that the momo crowd focuses only on the bullish factors and ignores the negative factors.&nbsp; In contrast, smart money takes into account both positive and negative factors. There are several negative factors about Apple that the stock market is ignoring right now that prudent investors should be aware of: Apple intelligence will likely not be available in the European Union and China. Even in the U.S., most Apple Intelligence features will not be available right away. The launch of all Apple Intelligence features is staggered over a long period of time. The fact that Apple Intelligence that will initially be present in the iPhone is only half baked may delay the super cycle. The marketing hype about Apple Intelligence is way more than reality. Apple does not own its AI.&nbsp; Apple is licensing its AI from OpenAI. The model behind the AI that Apple is offering is not running on the iPhone or on Apple servers.&nbsp; The model appears to be running on &nbsp;NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) based servers owned by Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT). Apple has been receiving $20B per year from Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) to make Google the default search.&nbsp; A judge has ruled that Google is a monopolist.&nbsp; In due course, the government may force Google to stop paying $20B to Apple. In China, Apple is losing market share to Huawei. Many Chinese believe that Huawei phones are superior to the iPhone. Huawei is trying to crash Apple's iPhone part by introducing the world's first tri-fold phone. Due to geopolitics between the U.S. and China, nationalist sentiment in China is rising against the U.S.&nbsp; This poses a significant risk to Apple since about 20% of Apple sales come from China. We understand that investors are very loyal to Apple.&nbsp; Before sending us hate email for doing a comprehensive analysis, note that Apple is the largest position in The Arora Report&#8217;s ZYX Buy Model Portfolio.&nbsp; Long time members of The Arora Report are long AAPL stock from $4.68. Note that Warren Buffett has been selling AAPL stock. Prudent investors should also be aware that Apple can easily manipulate its stock.&nbsp; After the last Apple event when Apple had carefully staged to run up its stock, Apple stock started falling.&nbsp; Apple aggressively bought its own stock to cause a technical breakout.&nbsp;&nbsp; Apple is clearly anxious about today's event, as demonstrated by the fact that this event is taking place on a Monday, whereas Apple generally does not hold major events on Mondays.&nbsp; Apple is trying to get ahead of a potential European Commission decision on Apple being forced to pay $14B in taxes.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is aggressive buying in stocks this morning due to two reasons: A short squeeze is occurring. The technical pattern with the stock market, especially AI stocks traced on Friday afternoon, historically leads to a selloff on Monday.&nbsp;&nbsp;When stock futures did not open much lower on Sunday night, a short squeeze started.&nbsp; As the night went on, the short squeeze accelerated. The reason stock futures did not open much lower is because Japanese yen weakened.&nbsp; The weakening yen has saved AI stocks from a blood bath this morning.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that a short squeeze and weakening yen saved the stock market means that prudent investors should not become complacent.&nbsp; Pay attention to the protection band.&nbsp; See the Protection Band And What To Do Now section below.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Magnificent Seven Money Flows In the early trade, money flows are positive in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVDA, MSFT, GOOG, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA). In the early trade, money flows are negative in AAPL. In the early trade, money flows are positive in SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ). Momo Crowd And Smart Money In Stocks Investors can gain an edge by knowing money flows in SPY and QQQ. Investors can get a bigger edge by knowing when smart money is buying stocks, gold, and oil. The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD). The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV). The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF (NYSE:USO). Bitcoin Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is range bound.&nbsp; Bitcoin ETFs have seen a negative money flow of $1.2B in the last eight days.&nbsp; This is the longest streak of negative money flows in bitcoins ETFs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Protection Band And What To Do Now It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.&nbsp; The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.&nbsp; If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. A protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash.&nbsp; A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.&nbsp; When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.&nbsp; High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Traditional 60/40 Portfolio Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.&nbsp; Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time. The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls. The Arora Report correctly called the big artificial intelligence rally before anyone else, the new bull market of 2023, the bear market of 2022, new stock market highs right after the virus low in 2020, the virus drop in 2020, the DJIA rally to 30,000 when it was trading at 16,000, the start of a mega bull market in 2009, and the financial crash of 2008.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), NVDA, MSFT, GOOG, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA). In the early trade, money flows are negative in AAPL. In the early trade, money flows are positive in SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ). Momo Crowd And Smart Money In Stocks Investors can gain an edge by knowing money flows in SPY and QQQ. Investors can get a bigger edge by knowing when smart money is buying stocks, gold, and oil. The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD). The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV). The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF (NYSE:USO). Bitcoin Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is range bound.&nbsp; Bitcoin ETFs have seen a negative money flow of $1.2B in the last eight days.&nbsp; This is the longest streak of negative money flows in bitcoins ETFs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Protection Band And What To Do Now It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.&nbsp; The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.&nbsp; If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. A protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash.&nbsp; A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.&nbsp; When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.&nbsp; High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Traditional 60/40 Portfolio Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.&nbsp; Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

       "   \"Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) last week flagged higher capex spending as it battles to gain supremacy in the artificial intelligence arena, and nervy investors sold off the stock on worries concerning a potential margin contraction. A tech venture capitalist said on Monday that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) could be fairly insulated because of the strategy it has chosen. What Happened: Alphabet, Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) are on track to increase capex by about 43% this year, said Deepwater Asset Management&#8217;s Gene Munster in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Apple is a standout among the mega-cap techs, he suggested. &#8220;In what seems like it's operating in an alternate universe, $AAPL's CapEx is expected to be down 9% this year as the company monetizes its distribution in exchange for OpenAI's models and infrastructure,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is one of the reasons why Apple should see record margins sometime in the middle of next year.&#8221; In the March quarter, the company reported gross margin of 46.6%.

On Monday, Cupertino released a new software called Apple Intelligence in the developer beta of iOS 18.1 and the suite of AI features made available will help improve Siri, automatically generate emails and images and sort notifications. The software is expected to be released to the public later this year but it may not be part of the iPhone 16 that will be launched this fall and will be powered by the iOS 18. As Munster said, Apple announced in mid-June that it has forged a partnership with Sam Altman-led OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into the iPhone, iPad and Mac. The arrangement reportedly does not require Apple to pay for the OpenAI association, with the latter making money through distribution. Apple ended Monday&#8217;s session up 0.13% at $218.24, according to Benzinga Pro data.

       "   \"Shares of Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell modestly in premarket trading on Friday, and this assumes importance because all of its Magnificent 7 peers are staring down the barrel. On Thursday, after the market closed, Apple announced that its fiscal year 2024 third-quarter revenue and earnings per share both surpassed expectations and showed growth compared to the previous year. The stock did not respond positively in the after-hours session, as skeptics highlighted concerns about weakness in China. On the earnings call, Team Tim Cook guided September quarter revenue above the Street estimate and also talked up the company&#8217;s AI prospects. Reacting to the results, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives upped his price target for the stock from $275 to $28 and maintained an Outperform rating. The analyst said it was a &#8220;Gold-medal performance,&#8221; adding that the conference call was upbeat. He sees the stronger September guidance as just the &#8220;opening act for the main event which is an AI-driven super cycle starting with iPhone 16 launching in mid-September.&#8221; Tech venture capitalist and Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster said, &#8220;Apple's flywheel is flying,&#8221; said Munster, referring to the active installed base that hit a new record. &#8220;Big picture is it's all about FY25 and FY26 iPhone, Mac and iPad powered by Apple Intelligence.&#8221; See Also: Everything You Need to Know About Apple Stock In premarket trading, Apple stock edged down 0.09% to $218.17, according to Benzinga Pro data.

       "   'Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is losing its mojo in China&#8217;s crucial market as its domestic players gain ground. The uncertainty regarding the availability of the Apple Intelligence feature in the country is an additional downer. The iPhone maker&#8217;s market share in China plunged to sixth place from third in the second quarter of 2024. According to Canalys, Apple had a market share of 14%, down by two basis points year-on-year. Also Read: China&#8217;s Markets Still Manage To Get Nvidia AI Chips Via Smuggling: Report China&#8217;s smartphone shipment grew 10% year-on-year to over 70 million units in the second quarter. Vivo emerged as the number one with a 19% market share by shipping 13.1 million units, up by 15% year-on-year, driven by solid performance in offline channels and robust online sales during the Chinese e-commerce festival. OPPO remained in second position with a 16% market share after shipping 11.3 million units. HONOR came third with a market share of 15%, backed by shipments of 10.7 million units, implying a 4% growth year-on-year. Huawei Technologies Co bagged the fourth position with a 15% market share supported by shipments of 10.6 million units, which grew by 41% year-on-year. Xiaomi Corp (OTC:XIACF) (OTC:XIACY) came fifth with a market share of 14%, backed by a 17% year-on-year shipment increase to 10 million units. Canalys attributed the local brands&#8217; success to the early significant discounts and promotions backed by offline channel enhancements. The local brands continue to tap the Chinese premium smartphone market by integrating generative artificial intelligence, and their deep collaboration with regional supply chains is a significant advantage, Canalys noted. Canalys also flagged Apple&#8217;s struggle to maintain adequate inventory levels, keep retail prices in check, and maintain the margins of channel partners. Huawei&#8217;s $2,800 Mate XT trifold phone launching on September 20 coincides with the release of the iPhone 16 models. Apple&#8217;s iPhone 16 Pro Max&nbsp;starts at $1,199, while the standard iPhone 16 is $799. International Data Corporation (IDC)&nbsp;expects global smartphone shipments to increase by 5.8% to 1.23 billion units in 2024, marking a recovery with generative AI posing as a significant catalyst. However, due to higher competition in China, Android growth is expected to beat Apple iOS. As per IDC, Apple&#8217;s success hinges on its capability to forge&nbsp;local AI partnerships&nbsp;in China. Ivan Lam, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research told SCMP that iPhone market share in the premium segment will likely decline as Huawei and other Chinese brands gain traction. Apple has not yet revealed its plans for AI integration in China, which could place it at a disadvantage in the race to implement AI, SCMP cites Canalys analyst Lucas Zhong. However, Lam noted that pent-up demand for iPhone upgrades may still boost sales in China. Price Action: AAPL stock closed at $222.66 on Wednesday. image via Shutterstock']]}"

       "\"To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. Hope Pinned On Apple Intelligence Please click here for an enlarged chart of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Note the following: This article is about the big picture, not an individual stock.&nbsp; The chart of AAPL stock is being used to illustrate the point. The chart shows when the iPhone 15 was launched. The chart shows the move from iPhone 15 launch to today's iPhone 16 launch. Investors are hopeful that the move in AAPL stock from the iPhone 16 launch to the iPhone 17 will be much bigger compared to the stock move between the launch of iPhone 15 and iPhone 16. The chart shows that even though investors have stars in their eyes, for the short term, AAPL stock has traced a negative pattern. The chart shows that AAPL stock hit the top of the resistance zone in July. The chart shows that AAPL stock failed to penetrate the resistance zone. The chart shows that after AAPL stock failed to penetrate the resistance zone, it fell all the way to the bottom band of the support zone. The chart shows that AAPL stock rallied after falling to the bottom of the support zone. The chart shows that the rally stopped at the low band of the resistance zone. Investors are mostly focused on hopes that Apple Intelligence, the name for Apple's artificial intelligence, will start a new super cycle of iPhone sales, and thus lift Apple sales from being sluggish for a long time. Even though there is a lot of exuberance about Apple Intelligence, prudent investors need to remember that the momo crowd focuses only on the bullish factors and ignores the negative factors.&nbsp; In contrast, smart money takes into account both positive and negative factors. There are several negative factors about Apple that the stock market is ignoring right now that prudent investors should be aware of: Apple intelligence will likely not be available in the European Union and China. Even in the U.S., most Apple Intelligence features will not be available right away. The launch of all Apple Intelligence features is staggered over a long period of time. The fact that Apple Intelligence that will initially be present in the iPhone is only half baked may delay the super cycle. The marketing hype about Apple Intelligence is way more than reality. Apple does not own its AI.&nbsp; Apple is licensing its AI from OpenAI. The model behind the AI that Apple is offering is not running on the iPhone or on Apple servers.&nbsp; The model appears to be running on &nbsp;NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) based servers owned by Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT). Apple has been receiving $20B per year from Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) to make Google the default search.&nbsp; A judge has ruled that Google is a monopolist.&nbsp; In due course, the government may force Google to stop paying $20B to Apple. In China, Apple is losing market share to Huawei. Many Chinese believe that Huawei phones are superior to the iPhone. Huawei is trying to crash Apple's iPhone part by introducing the world's first tri-fold phone. Due to geopolitics between the U.S. and China, nationalist sentiment in China is rising against the U.S.&nbsp; This poses a significant risk to Apple since about 20% of Apple sales come from China. We understand that investors are very loyal to Apple.&nbsp; Before sending us hate email for doing a comprehensive analysis, note that Apple is the largest position in The Arora Report&#8217;s ZYX Buy Model Portfolio.&nbsp; Long time members of The Arora Report are long AAPL stock from $4.68. Note that Warren Buffett has been selling AAPL stock. Prudent investors should also be aware that Apple can easily manipulate its stock.&nbsp; After the last Apple event when Apple had carefully staged to run up its stock, Apple stock started falling.&nbsp; Apple aggressively bought its own stock to cause a technical breakout.&nbsp;&nbsp; Apple is clearly anxious about today's event, as demonstrated by the fact that this event is taking place on a Monday, whereas Apple generally does not hold major events on Mondays.&nbsp; Apple is trying to get ahead of a potential European Commission decision on Apple being forced to pay $14B in taxes.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is aggressive buying in stocks this morning due to two reasons: A short squeeze is occurring.
